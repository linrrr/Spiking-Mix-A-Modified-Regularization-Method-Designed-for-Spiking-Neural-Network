# Spiking-Mix: A Modified Regularization Method Designed for Spiking Neural Network
#### This repo holds the codes for Spiking-Mix.

[NeuBridge: bridging quantized activations and spiking neurons for ANN-SNN conversion](https://github.com/Intelli-Chip-Lab/NeuBridge)
<br>We use the model in this paper and **quantify values of activated neurons**. 
<br>**Quantization Coding (Before the Threshold) - Rate Coding + Delay Coding (During the Threshold) - Time Coding (After the Threshold)**

<br>**Limited Edition Coding (Before the Threshold) - Unboxing Ceremony (During the Threshold) - User-Generated Content (After the Threshold)**
<br><br>This model still uses the **LIF model** to accumulate the membrane voltage.
<br>This can more effectively **reduce the time-step required for accumulating**.
