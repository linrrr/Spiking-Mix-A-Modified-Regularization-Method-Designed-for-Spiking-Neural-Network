# Spiking-Mix: A Modified Regularization Method Designed for Spiking Neural Network
#### This repo holds the codes for Spiking-Mix.
#### Neuron
[NeuBridge: bridging quantized activations and spiking neurons for ANN-SNN conversion](https://github.com/Intelli-Chip-Lab/NeuBridge)
<br>We referenced the model in this paper and activated neurons by quantifying the input values. 
<br>This model still uses the LIF model to accumulate the membrane voltage.
<br>This method can reduce the time-step required for conversion.
#### Architectures
For network architectures, we support ResNet and Wide-Resnet.
